name: Public Benchmark Suite (storage-focused)
description: |
  This benchmark focuses on workloads that strongly differentiate storage backends.

  The previous public suite included many "full block precompile" payloads which are CPU-bound and can dominate runtime
  in CI without providing much signal about KV/store performance. Those remain available in other configs (e.g.
  `configs/public/mainnet-cross-section.yml`).
